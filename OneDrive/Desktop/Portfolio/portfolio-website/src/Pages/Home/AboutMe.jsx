                    My name is Emili and I'm a first-generation, low-income, Latina student.
                     <br/>
                     Because of my background, I was set to pave the path early on. I witnessed what it meant to struggle financially and essentially gained the role of a second mother to my younger sibling. I knew that whatever career path I chose- I needed to give pass down all my resources and help to my brother.
                    <br/>
                    In college now, I participate in organizations like Wiscience, where I help welcome freshmen from minority backgrounds, host events to teach them about academic and professional opportunities. I also am a student ambassador for the College of Letters & Science at my school where I have the opportunity to make a change for POC communities at my school. I aspire to not only pursue my dreams but help people like me and my brother forge that pathway too.
